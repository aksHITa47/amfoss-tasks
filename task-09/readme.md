## Spammer Spaghetti
Originally, this task was to spam a friend on telegram web using javascript. I started reading about JS and HTML DOM. While googling I
stumbled upon [this](https://gist.github.com/scriptnull/7877b404f33de2b7445a) perfectly working script for the task. So, on the instructions
of [Vchrombie](https://github.com/vchrombie) I wrote a code for Github Gist Spammer, which as far as I and Vchrombie know, the code for which
is not available as such.
