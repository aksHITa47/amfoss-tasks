# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?

I love analysing a problem and coming up with the various ways to implement the core logic that a given problem is based on. And I think 
working alongside the members of this club will help me grow in the right direction, both as an engineer and a person. Truth be told, I am 
not good at keeping up with the personal challenges I set for myself unless I have some external pressure of deadlines or the fear of letting 
others down. I need an environment where I can motivate myself to keep going even when I feel like giving up. Also, I need to work on my
social skills. So, I think being a part of this communiy will help me a lot.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Study for a good CGPA. Polish my coding skills and delve more into the world of open source community.  

### How would you contribute back to the club?

By being helpful, supportive and willing to learn so as share my knowledge and experience with those seeking it.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The tasks were definitely challenging. I am sure they are designed in a way to give us a taste of what we will be working with in the future,
but I think it'd have been better if we were asked to make one mini project based on one language that would've required us to 
know that programming language in detail.
