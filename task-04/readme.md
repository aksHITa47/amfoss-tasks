The very first thing I did even before compiling the code was to uncomment ***import java.awt.Font*** coz that stood out immediately xD.
Then the syntax errors of not terminating the instructions with a semicolon **(;)**, not following case sensitivity and the logical errors
like swapped radio buttons for **Start** and **Stop**, or the wrong count starting from 23 with an increment of 23 per wrong answer.
