So, this task was about installing Ubuntu and it was not a straightforward job for sure. Luckily for me, I read a couple of blogs and watched
some YouTube tutorials highlighting what problems one might face while dual booting and installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 10, so I was
all ready to go ahead with the installation.
I got thrown a curveball when at the last stages of installation it showed an error *Turn off RST*, [this](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-installation-on-computers-with-intel-r-rst-enabled/15347)
blog helped me figure it out.
