This was a challenging, albeit an interesting task. The very first step was *calling the Github API* for which 
I used the **PyGitHub** library to help me manage the *GitHub* resources in the python code and this [amazingly elaborate markdown file](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/master/README.md)
was what I referred to. I had to generate a Personal Access Token to deal with the authentication issues. The main thing to figure out
was *how to use shell commands in python*, and this [[blog]](https://janakiev.com/blog/python-shell-commands/) helped me do just that. 
I did get sidetracked for a while with the *perceval backends* after reading [[this]](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/blob/master/perceval/git.md).
At the end I did manage to send Sir Perceval on a successful quest.
