## About my tasks
The tasks have catapulted my journey into the open source community and the vast opportunities in the field of Computer Science and tech.
I learned how to break down seemingly daunting problems into smaller doable tasks to build upon. Although, I wasn't able to do all of the tasks, I did learn a lot of new things and the direction I need to take to learn even more.
